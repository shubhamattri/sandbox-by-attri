## Context

We were paying a premium for a vendor-provided market data feed — bloated, opaque, and license-restricted.

So we built our own. And saved the bank €200,000 annually.

## What We Did

- Created a unified Golden Source API internally
- Standardized access for 10+ downstream consumers
- Implemented lineage tracking, usage governance, and reliability thresholds
- Added real-time license compliance control

## The Real Work

- Defined the schema across conflicting vendor specs
- Modeled fallback logic from shadow systems
- Trained users to migrate with zero downtime
- Built monitoring hooks into Grafana and Alerta

## What Made It Work

- Treating API as a product
- Aligning with security + compliance from day 1
- Building detailed logging from the start
- Educating consumers with real doc and demo flows

## Final Impact

- €200K annual savings
- More control, less dependency
- A real culture shift: internal systems can win, too.
