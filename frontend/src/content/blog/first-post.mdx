# Building My Personal Website with Next.js

Hello! I'm excited to share my journey of building this personal website using modern web technologies.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js has become my go-to framework for building React applications. Here's why:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Better SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Lightning-fast loading
- **API Routes** - Built-in backend functionality
- **TypeScript Support** - Type safety out of the box

## The Tech Stack

My website uses a carefully curated tech stack:

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** - React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless functions
- **MongoDB Atlas** - Cloud database
- **Resend** - Email functionality

## Key Features

1. **Responsive Design** - Works perfectly on all devices
2. **Contact Form** - Integrated with email service
3. **Blog System** - MDX-powered content
4. **Animations** - Smooth page transitions
5. **Performance** - Optimized for speed

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add:

- [ ] Newsletter subscription
- [ ] Project showcase
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Analytics integration
- [ ] SEO optimization

Stay tuned for more updates!
