# My Journey from IIT Delhi to Tech Leadership

Hello! I'm excited to share my professional journey from graduating IIT Delhi to becoming a senior tech leader and GitHub Copilot SPOC.

## The Foundation: IIT Delhi

My journey began at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, where I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering (2016-2020). The rigorous academic environment and exposure to cutting-edge research shaped my technical foundation.

### Academic Projects That Shaped My Path

During my time at IIT Delhi, I worked on two significant research projects:

1. **Atari Breakout AI** - Developed a CNN model in PyTorch to predict rewards, training on 500 gameplay samples with 2000 images (160x210) preprocessed with PCA.

2. **Yinsh AI-Bot** - Created a two-player Yinsh Bot on a hexagonal board, implementing Alpha-beta pruning with Bitboards and Zobrist Hashing for accelerated move generation.

## Professional Growth: From MEAN Stack to Leadership
